Accessibility is not granted to the process running LangMesh, so it cannot read or
control other applications.

**Do not guess which entry to enable.** macOS attaches this permission to the
application that *launched* LangMesh, not to LangMesh itself: started from a terminal it
is that terminal (Terminal, iTerm), and started from the packaged app it is LangMesh.
Tell the user that, ask which they used, and let them find the right row in System
Settings › Privacy & Security › Accessibility. An entry named "LangMesh" may not exist
at all.

Say this plainly and wait for them. Nothing on the screen is reachable until it is
granted, and no other approach gets around it.
