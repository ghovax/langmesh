Chrome's debugging endpoint answered but refused the connection: {{ detail }}

The switch is already on — the port file was read — so this is not something turning it
on again would fix, and toggling it off and back on would dismiss any approval prompt
currently waiting. The likely causes are an approval that was declined, a browser that
has since quit, or a port file left behind by an older session. Ask the user whether
Chrome is running and whether they saw a prompt, before trying again.
