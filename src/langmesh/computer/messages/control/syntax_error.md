That script didn't run — it has a syntax error, so nothing in it was executed:

{{ rendered }}

That is the interpreter's own report: the line, the column it stopped at, and what it
expected. Fix it there and run the script again.

control_screen runs your script the way a notebook cell runs, not as a function body:
write your statements, and to report a value, leave it as a bare expression on the last
line — or `print` whatever you want back. There is no top-level `return`; a plain
trailing expression is what takes its place, and a `return` outside a function is itself
a syntax error.
