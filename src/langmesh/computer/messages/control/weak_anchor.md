Your query "{{ query }}" was anchored to `near="{{ anchor }}"`, but that anchor itself
matched nothing clearly — several elements fit those words about equally well, so there
is no single place to search near, and nothing was acted on.

An anchor organises the whole ranking around one element. Anchoring to the wrong one is
worse than not anchoring at all, because the answer comes back looking just as
confident, so this refuses rather than guesses.

Name the anchor by something the surface actually says. Run a plain `find_many` for it
first and copy the wording off a result, or anchor to a different neighbour that is
unique — a heading, a filename, a label beside the control you want. If nothing near it
is unique, drop `near=` and pick from `find_many` by `parent` or `bounds` instead.
