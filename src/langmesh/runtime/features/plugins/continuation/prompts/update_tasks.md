Update the status of one or more tasks at once.

- Mark a task `in_progress` when the work starts; `completed` only when it is truly done; `blocked` where reality stops the work.
- Reconcile the list before you end a turn, and read it at the start of each turn to orient yourself. Update on a real change of state, never as busy-work. Never end a turn with completed work still shown as unresolved.

Arguments:
- `updates` — A list of update objects. Each holds:
  - `task_id` (required) — The task identifier, given as its index, such as "1".
  - `status` (required) — One of 'pending', 'in_progress', 'completed' or 'blocked'.
