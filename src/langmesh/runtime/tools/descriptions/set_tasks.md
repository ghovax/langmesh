Create new tasks in the task list. A task can depend on another.

Reach for this early: the moment two or more things wait, or one request holds distinct parts, create the entries. Make one entry per request and use `dependencies` to set the order.

**The list accumulates, and never replaces.** A new request joins what is already there, so five requests mean five entries and an earlier pending one is never dropped to make room.

Use this to break complex work into steps that run in parallel or in order. A task with no dependency can start at once. A task with a dependency waits for that dependency to complete.

Keep each task short and factual, and tie it to work somebody can observe. Skip the list for work that your next response finishes. Once you create the list, keep it true to reality with `update_tasks`.

This call takes these arguments:

- `tasks` — A list of task objects. Each holds:
  - `description` (required) — What somebody must do.
  - `dependencies` (optional) — A list of task identifiers this task waits for, such as ["task-...", ...].
