Read one session's current state: which agent profile it runs, whether its process is alive, whether a turn is in flight, and whether it waits on a person.

- Use this to orient yourself, never to wait. Do not call it in a loop to learn whether a peer finished; a peer's result reaches you on its own.

Arguments:
- `session` — The id of the session to read. Required.
