Update the status of one or more tasks at once.

Mark a task `in_progress` when the work starts. Mark it `completed` only when it is truly done. Mark it `blocked` where reality stops the work.

Reconcile the list before you end a turn, and read it at the start of each turn to orient yourself. Update on a real change of state, never as busy-work. Never end a turn with completed work still shown as unresolved.

This call takes these arguments:

- `updates` — A list of update objects. Each holds:
  - `task_id` (required) — The task identifier, such as "task-...".
  - `status` (required) — One of 'pending', 'in_progress', 'completed' or 'blocked'.
