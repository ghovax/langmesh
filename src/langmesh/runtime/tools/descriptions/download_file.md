Download a file from a URL to a path, past the usual bot and TLS blocks.

- Impersonates a full browser TLS and HTTP/2 fingerprint and uses the configured proxy, so files a plain download cannot reach still come through.
- Use `fetch_url` to read a page's text; this tool saves raw bytes (PDF, archive, dataset). It cannot pass an interactive JavaScript challenge or a CAPTCHA. It writes a file; a read-only agent does not have it.
- Waits up to `timeout` seconds; a download still running moves to the background and finishes on its own, and the harness holds the destination path against a concurrent edit until it does. `hard_deadline` is a separate network cutoff that aborts the transfer itself. `background=true` backgrounds it at once.

Arguments:
- `url` — A complete http or https URL for the file.
- `path` — Where to save it, relative to the working directory or absolute.
- `location` — Which workspace location receives the file — its URI or its name, from the locations in your context. Defaults to the local filesystem. Pass it only to reach a different, remote location.
- `timeout` — How many seconds to wait inline before the download moves to the background. It does not abort the download.
- `hard_deadline` — How many seconds before the transfer itself aborts.
- `background` — Skip the inline wait, and background the download at once.
- `explanation` — A short reason for the download, in the words the user reads.
