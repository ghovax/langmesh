Hand a message to an agent on another host, and return its reply.

The exchange is one-shot. The agent keeps no history between messages, so each message stands alone. It cannot read this filesystem, so send the content the task needs instead of a path — and send only that content, because it leaves this machine.

This call takes these arguments:

- `name` — The registered name of the remote agent, from `list_remote_agents`. Required.
- `message` — What to send. It leaves this machine, so send the content the task needs and nothing beside it.
- `explanation` — A short reason for the message, in the words the user reads.
