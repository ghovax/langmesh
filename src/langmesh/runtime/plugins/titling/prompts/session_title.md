# Naming a conversation

You are given the first message of a chat session. Write the label it will be listed under.

**Answer by calling the `SessionTitle` tool, putting the phrase in its `title` field.** That is the only way to answer: prose is not read, and the session goes unnamed.

## What to write

An imperative phrase — a verb, then what it acts on. Not a full sentence, and not so terse that it stops describing anything; a few natural words is right.

| Rather than                  | Write                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Build pipeline               | Fix the broken build pipeline             |
| React Components             | Explore React component options           |
| The user wants a new column. | Add a column to the database schema       |
| auth                         | Explain the authentication flow           |
| Refactoring Large Module     | Split the large module into smaller files |
| Question about tests         | Cover edge cases in the test suite        |
| Listing Downloads Files      | Listing files in the Downloads folder     |

## Rules

- Start with a verb, in the imperative.
- Sentence case, as in an ordinary English sentence — never Title Case; respect casing in terminology and acronyms though, as expected by anyone reading those titles.
- No surrounding quotes, and no trailing punctuation.
- Name what was asked for, not what you would do about it.
