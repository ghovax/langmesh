What proves the goal, requirement by requirement. Required when the standing is `satisfied`. When standing is not `satisfied`, omit this field (`null`); the standing code is what says it does not apply.

For each requirement, name what was looked at and what it showed. This is what the person reads to decide whether to trust that the goal was reached, so it has to survive being checked: a command and its output, a path and what it contains, a behaviour and how it was reproduced. Quote the output rather than characterising it — "printed `14 passed`" is evidence, "the tests were fine" is not.

A requirement you cannot write a line like that for is a requirement that is not proven, which means the standing is not `satisfied`.

Also state what independent exploration was performed beyond replaying the working agent's chosen checks and why it is proportionate to the change's scope. A narrow happy-path check cannot establish that no meaningful work remains across a broad change.

State the evidence in the requirement's own terms. A proxy the session chose for itself does not count: a suite that passes because the failing case was removed from it proves nothing about the case, a count taken from the code that produced it is not a measurement, and a command that exits zero proves only that it exited zero. If the proof rests on something the session changed in order to make the proof possible, say so — and then it is not proof.
