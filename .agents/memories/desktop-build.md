LangMesh ships as **two independent macOS artifacts**: the harness
(`LangMesh Computer Use.app` — the CLI and `langmeshd`, which hosts every session, in
one image) and the desktop app (a Tauri v2 shell, Rust + a Next.js static export). The
app is a **client**. It does not contain the harness, does not spawn it, and is
powerless when no daemon is running — it reads the port and token `langmeshd` publishes
into the runtime directory, exactly as it would reach a daemon on another host.
Everything below is macOS-only and reproducible from a clean checkout. Never touch git
history; work in-branch.

## Two builds, neither triggering the other

- `packaging/build-daemon.sh` — the harness. `FORCE=1` overrides the freshness guard.
- `cd web && bun run tauri:build` — the app. Run it from `web/`, because
  `beforeBuildCommand`'s `../packaging` paths assume that is where you are.
- `packaging/sign-app.sh "packaging/dist/LangMesh Computer Use.app"` — sign the harness,
  which is what gives it the identity the Accessibility grant is attached to.
- `packaging/sign-app.sh web/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/LangMesh.app` — the
  same for the app.

`tauri.conf.json`'s `beforeBuildCommand` no longer invokes the freeze and
`bundle.resources` no longer exists, so the app build is a Rust compile and a static
export — nothing Python. Install the harness by `ditto`-ing it to `/Applications` and
symlinking `Contents/MacOS/langmesh` onto `PATH`; install the app the same way. The app
starts the daemon if needed and launches the window.

## Freezing the harness into a signed .app (the Accessibility identity trick)

`packaging/langmesh-daemon.spec` (PyInstaller) freezes `packaging/entry.py` into a
binary named `langmesh`. It is **one image with two entry points** — `langmesh` and
`langmeshd`, chosen by the first argument — which is not packaging convenience: every
session runs inside the daemon process, so the whole fleet carries the signed bundle's
identity and one Accessibility grant covers it, without any session ever being spawned.
Heavy deps use dynamic imports (litellm, uvicorn[standard], langchain, a2a), so the spec
`collect_all`s them explicitly and `copy_metadata`s the ones read via
`importlib.metadata`. `.agents/{agents,skills}` + `mcp.json` are bundled at the frozen
root (the shipped base layer; `.agents/memories` is NOT shipped).

`build-daemon.sh` smoke-tests the frozen daemon before finishing: it launches it **with
the `langmeshd` argument** (a bare launch lands in the CLI and exits) under a
**throwaway set of XDG directories**, and waits for it to answer `/health` on its own
unix socket. The loopback port is ephemeral, so the probe is the socket, never a fixed
port.

The isolation is the point, not hygiene. Started with the developer's own XDG roots, the
frozen daemon finds `langmeshd.lock` held by whatever daemon they are running, logs
"Another langmeshd already holds the runtime directory; standing down", and **exits 0**
— and a probe that checked the socket first then found *that* daemon answering and
reported success for a binary it had never run. Liveness of the child is now checked
before the socket, for the same reason.

The spec ends in a `BUNDLE(...)` step that wraps the frozen output as
**`LangMesh Computer Use.app`** with `CFBundleName="LangMesh"`,
`bundle_identifier="com.ghovax.langmesh"`, `LSUIElement=True`. Both artifacts carry that
same name and identifier, which is why signing both with one certificate keeps them a
single **LangMesh** row in Accessibility — and why the wrapper survived the app no
longer bundling anything.

`packaging/Entitlements.plist` moved from the app to the daemon, where it always
belonged: `apple-events` for the login-items and running-apps probes,
`disable-library-validation` for PyInstaller's dylibs. Both were the daemon's
requirements, sitting on the app only because the app was its parent process.

Why a bundle, not a bare binary: the *daemon* — not the Tauri shell — is the process
that calls the macOS Accessibility API for the computer-use tool, and TCC lists
whichever process exercises a permission. A bare binary shows its raw filename in System
Settings ▸ Privacy ▸ Accessibility. Wrapped as a bundle carrying the **same**
`CFBundleName` + identifier as the desktop app and signed with the same cert, it folds
into the app's single **"LangMesh"** entry instead of a second row, and — because the
identity is stable — the grant survives rebuilds. This is also why sessions run inside
the daemon rather than as separate helpers: a different path is a different identity,
and would prompt once per session.

macOS caches `AXIsProcessTrusted` per process, so after granting, the **daemon must
restart** to see the grant (it is the process that asks). Restarting the *app* no longer
does that — the daemon is not its child. The Settings dialog asks the daemon to restart
itself over the control plane (`daemon.restart`), which **keeps live sessions** — the
registry is durable, so each one loses only its executor and comes back asleep — then
calls the `restart_app` Tauri command to reload the webview against the fresh daemon and
auto-enables computer-control on return (localStorage
`langmesh:pendingComputerControlEnable`).

## The self-signed codesign identity (stable across rebuilds)

Ad-hoc signing changes the cdhash every build, which invalidates the TCC grant. Instead
`packaging/create-signing-certificate.sh` makes a persistent self-signed identity
**"LangMesh Local Codesign"** in the login keychain. Gotcha: use **`/usr/bin/openssl`**
(LibreSSL) for the p12 — openssl 3.x writes a MAC that `security import` rejects ("MAC
verification failed"). Import with `security import -A -T /usr/bin/codesign`.

`packaging/sign-app.sh` takes one or both artifacts. The daemon gets `--deep` plus
`packaging/Entitlements.plist` (its dylibs, its Apple Events); the app signs plain,
having neither nested code nor those needs. Each bundle takes its identifier from its
own Info.plist (both `com.ghovax.langmesh`); no hardened runtime, so PyInstaller's
dylibs still load.

## Icon — Apple's own no-Xcode pipeline

`packaging/export-icon.py` drives Icon Composer's own `ictool` over
`web/src-tauri/LangMesh.icon`, exporting a 1024² macOS rendition; that export becomes
`app-icon.png` for the non-macOS platform assets, `icon.icns` is written directly
through Pillow at every size in `MACOS_ICON_SIZES`, and `tauri icon` generates the rest.
No squircle or glass is hand-drawn — modern macOS applies the rounded-rect mask itself.
Do NOT hand-roll the icon; the `.icon` document is the source of truth and this script
is the sanctioned way to render it.

## Size, and the two gotchas behind it

The frozen harness is ~228 MB; it was 1.8 GB. Neither cause was the freezer — swapping
PyInstaller for Nuitka would not have helped (Nuitka's macOS onedir/.app output is
typically ~2× PyInstaller's and much slower to build).

1. **Committed skill `.venv` rode into the freeze.**
   `.agents/skills/literature-search/scripts/.venv` is a committed ~145 MB uv devshell
   (pymupdf/libmupdf 33 MB, lxml, numpy, PIL). The spec walks `.agents/{agents,skills}`
   file-by-file (`_bundle_tree`) and prunes regenerable runtime artifacts (`.venv`,
   `__pycache__`, `.git`, `node_modules`, tool caches) instead of a wholesale
   `datas.append((dir, dest))`. Skills recreate their venv on demand where they run.
1. **Tauri dereferenced PyInstaller's symlinks.** PyInstaller's codesignable layout puts
   real Mach-Os in `Contents/Frameworks`, real Python in `Contents/Resources`, and
   cross-symlinks each side so the import root sees one merged tree. Tauri's resource
   copier followed every one of those when it bundled the helper, turning each into a
   full second copy (~5×), and `sign-app.sh` had to `ditto` a pristine copy back before
   signing. **This is gone**: nothing bundles the daemon, so nothing dereferences it,
   and the repair step went with the coupling that required it.

## Freshness guard

`build-daemon.sh` skips the freeze when
`packaging/dist/LangMesh Computer Use.app/Contents/MacOS/langmesh` is newer than
everything that goes into it: `packaging/entry.py`, the spec, `pyproject.toml`,
`uv.lock`, `src/langmesh`, and `.agents/{agents,skills,mcp.json}`. `FORCE=1` rebuilds.
Two bugs it used to have, both fixed: it did not watch `.agents/` at all despite
bundling it, so a skill edit shipped stale; and it counted `__pycache__` and `.DS_Store`
as source changes, so merely running the harness forced a needless multi-minute
re-freeze. The `find` expression now prunes both.

The Python steps in this chain (`export-icon.py`, and `web/`'s `check:events`) go
through `uv run --project ..` rather than a hardcoded `.venv/bin/python`, so the build
works whether or not the virtualenv has been created yet.
