**An open coding agent you run yourself, and a harness you can edit.**

A coding agent needs more than a model. Something has to write the system prompt, give the model its tools, decide what it may run without asking, and keep the conversation from overflowing. That layer is the harness, and it decides more about the result than the model does. In most products it is closed. In LangMesh it is the code you are reading, and you can change it.

## What it is

One conversation with an agent is a **session**. You create one, send it work, and it answers over its life. That is the only object in LangMesh, and everything below is a way of running one.

LangMesh is four layers. Each one uses the layer under it and adds a single thing:

1. **The library** — `import langmesh`. `langmesh.Session` runs an agent in your own process. You give it the agent, the model, the working directory and the credentials; it reads no file you did not name. This is the harness itself, and the three layers above are all built on it. See [As a library](documentation/library.md).
2. **The machine loaders** — `langmesh.daemon.machine`. These read your configuration file and the agents in your `.agents` directory, and turn them into what the library takes. This is the first layer that knows your home directory exists.
3. **The daemon** — `langmeshd`. It hosts every session, keeps the register of what exists, owns the databases, and answers every call. That buys three things the library alone cannot. A session outlives the program that made it, another machine can reach it, and it is addressable by name from anywhere.
4. **The clients** — the `langmesh` command, the macOS app, and a phone. All three talk to the daemon and contain no harness of their own. Anything one can do, the others can. The phone reaches it over `langmesh reach`, which is the one surface here that is meant to leave the machine — a loopback listener that Tailscale fronts with a stable name and a real certificate, opt-in and authenticated. See [`langmesh reach`](documentation/cli.md#reaching-it-from-a-phone).

An agent can use these too. When a session needs help it creates a second session and messages it, over the same API your terminal uses. The helper appears in `langmesh ps`, you can watch it, and it ends when its parent does. Its answer arrives as a message, in its own words.

## Why own the harness

The harness writes the system prompt, defines the tools, manages context, and sets what the agent may do. The same model does different work under different harnesses — OpenCode versus Claude Code or Codex, say. LangMesh lets you change that layer:

- **Tune the guardrails.** Permission modes and per-command rules are configuration. The engine that enforces them is open code. When the settings are not enough, you can change how permissioning works ([Permissions](documentation/configuration.md#permission-modes)).
- **The agent can work on LangMesh itself.** Its prompt says that it runs LangMesh. Open the LangMesh repository as the project. The agent then reads and edits the harness, and you rebuild ([Architecture](documentation/architecture.md)).
- **The agent can start with context about you** — an opt-in snapshot of your machine and habits, off by default ([What it sends](SECURITY.md#what-the-agent-sends-to-your-model-provider)).

## Install

LangMesh runs on **macOS on Apple Silicon**. It ships as two downloads:

- **The daemon bundle**, which carries the harness, the daemon and the `langmesh` command in one signed image.
- **The app**, which is the window that talks to it.

Download the latest release, install both, and run `langmesh app`. The build is self-signed, so Gatekeeper warns you at the first launch. You can also build from source with the Nix-pinned toolchain.

See the [Installation guide](documentation/installation.md) for both paths in full.

## Quickstart

The same harness, reached three ways. Start at the layer you want: an object in your own program, a session you can address from a terminal, or a window.

### As a library

No daemon, no socket, and nothing read from or written to your home directory. The agent, its prompt and its credentials are values in your program:

```python
import asyncio
from langmesh import AgentConfiguration, FilesystemConfiguration, SandboxConfiguration, Session

reviewer = AgentConfiguration(
    name="reviewer",
    description="Reads a change and reports what it would break.",
    system_prompt="You review changes. Name the risk, or say there is none.",
    sandbox=SandboxConfiguration(filesystem=FilesystemConfiguration(writable=[])),
    provider="anthropic",
    model="claude-opus-4-5",
)

async def main() -> None:
    async with Session(
        reviewer,
        directory="/srv/checkout",
        providers={"anthropic": "sk-ant-…"},
    ) as session:
        answer = await session.ask("What would break if I removed the retry loop in the fetcher?")

asyncio.run(main())
```

`stream()` instead of `ask()` gives typed live events. Replaceable behavior lives in one immutable `SessionComponents` value:

```python
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langmesh import SessionComponents

components = SessionComponents(model=ChatAnthropic(model="claude-opus-4-5"))
async with Session(reviewer, directory="/srv/checkout", components=components) as session:
    async for event in session.stream("Summarise what the test suite covers."):
        ...  # Consume each typed event as it arrives.
```

`SessionComponents` exposes models, prompt and attachment composition, checkpoints, jobs, transcripts, approvals, audit, tools, permission policy, hooks, middleware, compaction, continuation, peer sessions, MCP servers, workspaces, file leases, credentials, and tracing. Execution locations are immutable run facts passed to `Session`. Workspace data uses `WorkspaceResourcesLike`, normally the fsspec-backed `WorkspaceResources`.

```python
from langmesh import Session, WorkspaceResources

resources = WorkspaceResources.memory({"README.md": "# Virtual workspace"})
async with Session(reviewer, resources=resources, providers={"anthropic": "sk-ant-…"}) as session:
    answer = await session.ask("Add a short usage section to the README.")
assert b"usage" in (await resources.read("README.md") or b"").lower()
```

Observational memory belongs to those workspace resources, not the session: the agent maintains `.agents/observations.sqlite` through Bash, Git can track it, and LangMesh reads it for presentation, fold verification, and a constant-sized progressive-disclosure descriptor in the system prompt. The descriptor contains only path, revision, counts, and timestamp extent; the agent retrieves relevant entries on demand rather than receiving an ever-growing prompt block.

Library callers can read or subscribe to the same validated current-state registry without starting a daemon or polling:

```python
from langmesh import ObservationRegistry, WorkspaceResources

resources = WorkspaceResources.local("/srv/checkout")
registry = ObservationRegistry(resources)
snapshot = await registry.load()
for observation in snapshot["entries"]["observations"]:
    observation_id = observation["id"]
    claim = observation["claim"]

descriptor = await registry.describe()  # path, revision, counts, and timestamp extent only

async for changed in registry.watch():
    revision = changed["revision"]
    entries = changed["entries"]
```

The same configured `ObservationRegistry(resources)` object works with a virtual backend. Watching requires a push-based `ResourceChangeSource`: local resources use watchdog, in-memory resources publish after each committed write, and remote adapters provide their provider's native notifications. LangMesh never substitutes a busy loop. A configured `Session` exposes this same object as `session.observations`, so code already driving an agent does not configure the resource boundary twice.

All three methods are read-only and create nothing. `describe()` supports progressive disclosure without loading any entry payload: it validates storage integrity and returns the resolved path, existence, revision, per-ledger counts, and earliest/latest update timestamps. `load()` and `watch()` additionally validate every payload and timestamp. A malformed registry raises `ObservationRegistryError`; the app also shows that failure and privately gives it to the agent at the next model-call boundary so it can repair the file through the documented Bash protocol.

Pass `configuration=custom_configuration` when constructing the registry if the configured project `.agents` root is somewhere other than its default relative location.

Three more sit around the turn: bound it, wrap its tools, decide how its history folds. Each one is an object with a method or two, so your own is as short as the ones that ship:

```python
from langmesh import KeepRecentTurns, MaximumToolCalls, Session, SessionComponents

class RefuseNetworkTools:
    """A hook. Sees the batch the permission rules approved, and narrows it."""

    async def before_tools(self, calls):
        return [call for call in calls if call["name"] not in ("fetch_url", "search_web")]

class Timed:
    """Middleware. Wraps every tool call, yours and the harness's alike."""

    async def run(self, call, proceed):
        started = time.monotonic()
        try:
            return await proceed(call)
        finally:
            metrics.timing("langmesh.tool", time.monotonic() - started, tags={"tool": call.name})

async with Session(
    reviewer,
    directory="/srv/checkout",
    components=SessionComponents(
        hooks=(MaximumToolCalls(20), RefuseNetworkTools()),
        middleware=(Timed(),),
        compaction=KeepRecentTurns(20),
    ),
) as session:
    ...
```

A hook narrows and can never widen: `before_tools` runs after the permission barrier. The [library documentation](documentation/library/index.md) covers composition, lifecycle, customization, compaction, persistence, and the complete API.

A program running on a managed machine can deliberately load its agent catalogue through `langmesh.daemon.machine`. The [library guide](documentation/library/index.md) documents the public seams, durable control state, persistence examples, and product boundary.

### From the terminal

| Command                                                                | What it does                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `langmesh create --agent general-assistant --directory ~/code/project` | Creates a session and prints its id    |
| `langmesh send <id> "What does this project do?" --wait`               | Sends it work and waits for the answer |
| `langmesh ps`                                                          | Shows what runs, and what waits on you |
| `langmesh attach <id>`                                                 | Follows it live                        |

A session composes over the API, not over this command. `create_session` makes a peer and gives it a brief, `message_session` reaches a session in either direction, and `end_session` stops one.

These use the same daemon, the same sockets, and the same tree. The tool carries the caller's identity, which an argv string cannot do. A peer is therefore always a child of whoever made it, and its answer arrives as a message.

The daemon starts itself on the first command.

### From the app

1. **Launch LangMesh.** The daemon starts automatically; the app connects to it.
2. **Add a model key.** Open **Settings**, then **Providers**, and paste a key for any provider. You can also sign in with a ChatGPT or Cursor subscription. Then pick a model. Keys live in your LangMesh configuration file — see the [Configuration guide](documentation/configuration.md), or run `langmesh configure --all` to see every setting there is.
3. **Start a conversation.** Type a task. Approve tool calls as they come up, or relax the [permission mode](documentation/configuration.md#permission-modes) once you trust a flow.

The screen-control tools need a one-time Accessibility grant and Chrome's remote-debugging toggle — see the [Installation guide](documentation/installation.md#permissions-the-app-may-ask-for).

> [!NOTE]
> You can opt in to send a snapshot of how you work. The system prompt then carries it to your model provider. This is off by default. See [what the agent sends to your model provider](SECURITY.md#what-the-agent-sends-to-your-model-provider).

## How it compares

The closest tools are [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) and [OpenAI Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex). Both are more mature than LangMesh. In 2026 both also drive a real browser and control native macOS apps. Codex is open source too, and it runs on models that are not OpenAI's. This table compares approaches. It does not list things that only LangMesh does.

| **Screen control** | Native macOS apps and your own Chrome, read as ranked accessibility/DOM elements from a plain-language search — screenshots only when you ask | Your real Chrome session, plus macOS computer use driven by downscaled screenshots (research preview, Pro/Max)                 | In-app and Chrome-extension browser, plus background macOS computer use driven by screenshots               |
| **Reach**          | Terminal-first (`langmesh`), plus a desktop app over the same API; every session is scriptable and attachable                                 | Terminal, VS Code, JetBrains, desktop, web, mobile, Slack, CI, GitHub review; macOS and Windows                                | CLI, IDEs, desktop, cloud/web, Chrome, GitHub review; macOS and Windows                                     |

Three design choices distinguish LangMesh:

- **Structure, not screenshots.** LangMesh reads the screen as a semantic search over the accessibility tree and the DOM. It returns a few ranked elements. The other tools reason over screenshots. A query here costs a few elements, not an image.
- **A session is addressable, not a function call.** A session has a name, a durable record and an inbox, and it outlives whatever made it. To make a peer, a session creates another session and messages it. It uses the API that a person uses, and gets an answer as a message rather than a return value.
- **A composed script, not a click-by-click loop.** `control_screen` runs a Python program. Its primitives (`click`, `type`, `scroll`, `evaluate`) are the same on native apps and in the browser. One call can loop over rows, branch on what it finds, and call the page's own API. The other tools need one round trip for each click. LangMesh needs far fewer model turns.

The trade-off: it needs an accessibility tree or DOM to read, where a screenshot approach works on anything drawn on screen. See [Tools](documentation/tools.md).

Elsewhere they lead. They have more polish, more places to run, and deeper ecosystems. Claude Code has subagents, hooks, plugins, and an Agent SDK. Codex has cloud tasks, more than 90 plugins, and automatic PR review. All three tools gate actions behind approvals and a sandbox.

LangMesh is the small, open, model-agnostic option that you host yourself. For a mature agent on a vendor's cloud, use theirs.

## Where things live

LangMesh follows the XDG convention. It does not use a single dot-directory:

- Configuration in `~/.config/langmesh`
- Durable state in `~/.local/share/langmesh`
- Sockets in the runtime directory
- Logs in `~/.local/state/langmesh`
- Caches in `~/.cache/langmesh`

The OS clears the runtime directory when you log out. A crashed daemon therefore leaves nothing behind.

Only the holder of a session's handle can reach it. `create` mints a capability token. Every call to a session's socket must present that token. The daemon guards its own API the same way, with a token that it writes 0600 into the runtime directory.

That token does not say _which_ session is calling. A session runs as the same user and could read the file. So on the unix socket the daemon asks the kernel for the peer's pid. It resolves the pid to a session through the process session that every worker leads. A call is therefore attributed to whoever made it.

> [!NOTE]
> A session's permission mode can be changed while it runs, and the change reaches the turn already in flight — a conversation that starts under manual approvals and earns trust does not have to be restarted to run under a looser mode. A child gets a mode no looser than its parent's, and tightening a session tightens everything it created. There is no bypass mode and no standing "always allow"; the only decisions at runtime are allow-once and deny. See the [Security notes](SECURITY.md).
