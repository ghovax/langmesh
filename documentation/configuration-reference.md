# Configuration reference

Every setting LangMesh has, in the order the settings panel presents them: what you decide first at the top, the numbers underneath everything at the bottom.

A setting is addressed by its dotted path, and the same path works everywhere — in `~/.config/langmesh/configuration.yaml`, in `langmesh configure`, and as the key the interface writes. Nothing is written to that file until you change it: a setting you have never touched follows the default, including when a release moves it.

Everything `langmesh configure` does:

- `langmesh configure` — what this machine has been set to, as one object.
- `langmesh configure --all` — every setting there is, each with what it ships at and what it currently runs on.
- `langmesh configure sandbox.enforce` — read one, printing the value and nothing else.
- `langmesh configure sandbox.enforce off` — change one, and print how it was stored.
- `langmesh configure sandbox.enforce --unset` — put it back, which removes it from the file rather than writing the default into it.

The settings panel shows the same set, with the name and the explanation in the language the interface is set to. The words there and the words here are the same words: they live in `shared/messages/`, keyed by these paths.

## Agent defaults

What a session runs under when its creator does not say.

| Setting                 | Type                | Default | What it is for                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agent.permission_mode` | `ask` / `automatic` | `ask`   | Who answers when a session asks to reach past its confinement when neither the person nor its agent profile chooses a mode. |

## Workspaces

Where a session's tools run.

| Setting              | Type                           | Default | What it is for                                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `workspace.strategy` | `none` / `branch` / `worktree` | `none`  | Where a session's work happens: the project directory itself, a branch of its own, or a git worktree of its own. |

## Confinement

What a session's tool children may do, enforced by the operating system.

| Setting                        | Type                             | Default                                                                                                                                                       | What it is for                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sandbox.enforce`              | `required` / `preferred` / `off` | `required`                                                                                                                                                    | What to do on a machine that cannot enforce confinement: refuse to start the session, run with resource limits only, or do not confine. |

The system is readable and is not listed.                                                  |

Deliberately narrower than readable, because a wrong write is the failure people actually meet.           |
| `sandbox.filesystem.grantable` | list                             | —                                                                                                                                                             | Paths an agent may be granted at runtime without asking.

Wins over readable and writable, and no request opens them.                                                       |

Empty leaves the machine's own.                                                         |

## Session toolbox

Whether a session may install the tools it needs into a profile of its own.

| Setting           | Type    | Default | What it is for                                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `toolbox.enabled` | boolean | `true`  | Let each session install the tools it needs into a package profile of its own, deleted with the session. |

## Conversation compaction

How conversation history is folded as it grows.

| Setting                                  | Type    | Default  | What it is for                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `compaction.automatic`                   | boolean | `true`   | Reclaim context on its own as it fills. Manual compaction works either way.                                                                                                                |
| `compaction.assumed_context_window`      | integer | `128000` | Conservative scheduling capacity when a custom model reports no window. It can trigger preparation but never a local hard rejection, and the interface labels it as estimated.             |
| `compaction.reclaim_at_fraction`         | number  | `0.85`   | Recommended preparation boundary. A private local-Bash segment first updates the current observational registry and advances its revision; folding follows only after validation succeeds. |
| `compaction.output_reserve_fraction`     | number  | `0.1`    | Share held back as safety space for the preparation segment and the answer. The rest is the usable window every other fraction here is measured against.                                   |
| `compaction.recent_working_set_fraction` | number  | `0.25`   | Share of the usable window kept verbatim after older history is discarded. Sized in tokens rather than turns because an unattended run can be one turn with hundreds of tool results.      |

## User snapshot

Whether the system prompt describes how you work on this machine.

| Setting                      | Type    | Default | What it is for                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `user_context.enabled`       | boolean | `false` | Include a snapshot of how you work — your editor, your habits, your machine — in the system prompt.                 |
| `user_context.refresh_hours` | number  | `6`     | How old that snapshot may get before it is rebuilt. The rebuild runs in the background, so no message waits for it. |

## Screen control

Driving the screen.

| Setting                                               | Type    | Default                             | What it is for                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `computer_control.enabled`                            | boolean | `false`                             | Let the agent drive native applications and your browser. It also needs Accessibility granted in System Settings.                                                                      |
| `computer_control.settle.poll_seconds`                | number  | `0.05`                              | How often to re-check whether the surface has settled.                                                                                                                                 |
| `computer_control.settle.give_up_seconds`             | number  | `1.5`                               | The longest to wait before reading it anyway.                                                                                                                                          |
| `computer_control.retrieval.multilingual_rank_model`  | string  | `minishlab/M2V_multilingual_output` | The static embedding that ranks by meaning across languages. Also the model whose plain cosine backs the relevance floor, so clearing it disables that floor. Empty turns it off.      |
| `computer_control.retrieval.english_rank_model`       | string  | `minishlab/potion-base-32M`         | A second static embedding, ranked alongside the first rather than instead of it. Stronger on queries that describe what an element is for; weaker on exact labels. Empty turns it off. |
| `computer_control.retrieval.lexical_gate_short_words` | integer | `3`                                 | Queries of this many words or fewer are treated as a label quoted off the screen, and the character similarity counts in full.                                                         |
| `computer_control.retrieval.lexical_gate_long_words`  | integer | `7`                                 | Queries of this many words or more are treated as a description of a purpose, and the character similarity is ignored — its spelling agrees with nothing, so it ranks by coincidence.  |

## Dictation

Speaking to the composer instead of typing.

| Setting                                                      | Type    | Default                              | What it is for                                                                                                                                               |

| `dictation.timing.minimum_transcription_timeout_seconds`     | number  | `30.0`                               | The floor on how long one transcription may take before it is treated as wedged.                                                                             |
| `dictation.timing.transcription_timeout_realtime_multiplier` | number  | `0.5`                                | Added to the floor, per second of audio. Transcription runs comfortably faster than real time on Apple Silicon, so reaching the limit means stuck, not busy. |
| `dictation.timing.maximum_attempts`                          | integer | `2`                                  | How many workers one recording may be given.                                                                                                                 |

## Model providers

Credentials for each model provider. The provider's own environment variable wins over anything stored here.

| Setting     | Type | Default | What it is for                                                                                               |
| ----------- | ---- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| -------------- | ------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `jina.api_key` | string | —       | Jina API key, which raises the rate limit. JINA_API_KEY wins over this. |

## Page fetching (Firecrawl)

The fallback page-fetching engine.

| Setting             | Type   | Default | What it is for                                                     |

| `tuning.defaults.maximum_line_chars`             | integer | `2048`    | Characters of a single over-long line kept before it is clipped, so one minified blob cannot fill a result on its own.                                                                                                                                                 |
| `tuning.defaults.upstream_error_detail_tokens`   | integer | `256`     | Tokens of an upstream service's error body kept in the failure this harness raises — enough to carry the provider's own explanation, short of pasting a whole page into a message someone has to read.                                                                 |

| `tuning.defaults.frame_resolve_timeout`          | integer | `2000`    | How long resolving a frame reference waits. Deliberately well below the action timeout: a frame that has gone waits out its budget rather than erroring, and listing every frame would otherwise stall on the one that left.                                           |

| `tuning.defaults.bash_sync_window`               | number  | `60.0`    | How long a shell command runs inline before it moves to the background. It is not killed at this point, only handed off, and the model can override it per call.                                                                                                       |

| `tuning.defaults.accessibility_messaging`        | number  | `2.0`     | How long one accessibility message to an application waits, so a hung application costs a moment rather than the whole action.                                                                                                                                         |
| `tuning.defaults.goal_continuation_turns`        | integer | `12`      | How many turns in a row a session may open for its own goal before it stops and waits for the person. The goal review can end a run earlier than this; nothing can carry one past it.                                                                                  |
| `tuning.defaults.task_continuation_turns`        | integer | `12`      | How many turns in a row unfinished tracked tasks may reopen automatically before the session waits for the person. A new user message restores the allowance.                                                                                                      |
| `tuning.defaults.goal_blocked_turns`             | integer | `3`       | How many turns a goal must have been pushed before the reviewer may submit a "blocked" verdict. Until then it must submit "unmet" with a useful next message. One failure is not an impasse, and a goal abandoned on the first refusal is one nobody asked to abandon. |
| `tuning.defaults.session_title_attempts`         | integer | `3`       | How many times a session asks the model to name itself before giving up.                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| `tuning.defaults.daemon_probe_interval`          | number  | `0.05`    | Pause between asks of whether another process's daemon socket answers yet, or whether a daemon being replaced has finally exited.                                                                                                                                      |

| `tuning.defaults.oauth_poll_ceiling`             | number  | `10.0`    | Ceiling on the widening pause between sign-in polls, so a slow sign-in is not asked about every second for minutes.                                                                                                                                                    |

## Notes on individual tunables

Eleven of them carry more reasoning than a table row holds. This is where it is written down.

### `tuning.defaults.accessibility_walk_budget`

How long one read of an app's accessibility tree may take. It replaces a depth limit, which guarded the wrong quantity: a window six levels deep can take twice as long as one thirty-five levels deep, because the cost is how quickly the app answers, not how far down the answer is. Anything unread when this expires is reported as a region, so a short read says it is short.

### `tuning.defaults.find_anchor_margin`

How far ahead of its own runner-up a near= anchor must score before a find will join on it. Below this the anchor is a guess, and organising a ranking around a guess is worse than not anchoring: it catches a third of the failures for one correct answer in 242.

### `tuning.defaults.find_many_ceiling`

Elements find_many will return however many are asked for. There used to be an `all=True` that bypassed the limit entirely and returned the whole ranking; on one ordinary page that was 590 elements and 1.5MB, which ended the turn by exceeding the model's context window. A find is a ranked search, and the tail of a ranking is not more answer.

### `tuning.defaults.find_near_weight`

How much sitting beside the anchor is worth against matching the query, when a find names one with `near=`. Measured over 284 anchored cases on ten applications: relevance alone answers 20.8% of them and proximity alone 21.5%, while the two together answer 85.2%. Neither half carries this on its own.

### `tuning.defaults.find_one_margin`

How far ahead of the runner-up `find_one`'s best match must score, in units of the shortlist's own spread, before it answers with one element instead of asking which was meant.

Measured over 13,628 queries on 50 recordings: at 0.20 it asks on 15.0% of calls and takes precision from 54.0% to 58.5%, deferring 8.0% of the answers that were right. The curve is smooth and the choice is a budget rather than a discovery — 0.10 asks on 10.3% for 57.2%, 0.30 asks on 19.5% for 59.7%, 0.60 asks on 30.4% for 62.6%. Deferring is cheap because the answer is usually still in the shortlist it hands back: recall at eight among deferred calls is 65.5%.

Both the number and the quantity changed with the ranker. It used to be a fraction of the top score, which is meaningful for a cosine and not for a sum of standardised signals, where the score is comparable within one ranking and arbitrary between two. Re-fit this whenever the ranking changes rather than carrying the number across — the previous note said so about the key, and the ranker is the larger change.

### `tuning.defaults.find_relevance_floor`

How well an element must match, as a cosine against the query, before `find_many` will return it at all. It cuts the noise band and nothing more.

The limit of that is measured rather than assumed. On 596 elements of a real page, six paraphrased queries for things that WERE present scored 0.48 to 0.75 at top-1, while six for things that were plainly absent — a checkout button, a flight time — scored 0.26 to 0.59. Those distributions overlap, so no absolute cosine separates "here" from "not here" with this embedding. Set it where it removes the tail that is unambiguously noise (that page ran to -0.12) without touching the band where real matches live.

Treat an empty result as "nothing scored above the noise", never as proof of absence, and do not raise this hoping to buy absence detection — it would cost real matches first.

That claim has since been tested properly and it holds, which is worth recording because an easier test says otherwise. Against negatives drawn from unrelated screens the cosine looks like it separates present from absent well, at AUC 0.94 — but a query about a periodic table asked of the Finder is not the case a floor exists for. Against the real one — 12,304 queries written for a screen and then asked of that same screen with their own element removed — it is AUC 0.55, and a threshold refusing 90% of them would discard 84% of the answers that were present.

It stays a cosine against the query, deliberately, now that the ranking is a fusion. A fused score is scaled by the query's own length, so absent queries can outscore present ones on it (AUC 0.07) purely by being shorter. A floor has to read a number that means the same thing from one call to the next, and only the plain cosine does.

### `tuning.defaults.find_rephrasing_similarity`

How alike two screen queries must be, as a cosine in the retrieval model's own space, before a second one landing on the same element counts as the first asked again. Both halves are required: across 127 rephrasing sequences and 113 legitimate ones, likeness alone caught everything and cried wolf on 76% of honest work, while the same element reached from three wordings never cried wolf but missed 12% and noticed a call and a half later. Together: everything caught, 4% false, and noticed by the second query.

### `tuning.defaults.frame_resolve_timeout`

How long resolving a frame reference waits. Deliberately well below the action timeout: a frame that has gone waits out its budget rather than erroring, and listing every frame would otherwise stall on the one that left.

### `tuning.defaults.session_idle_sleep`

How long a session keeps its process after its last turn before it sleeps. Five hours by default: long enough that a working day of on-and-off use never pays a wake, short enough that a machine left overnight is not holding interpreters for conversations nobody returned to.
