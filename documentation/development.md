# Development

LangMesh has three parts:

- The **Python image**: one executable, entered as `langmesh` or `langmeshd`. It carries the harness.
- The **Next.js web UI**.
- The **Tauri desktop shell**. In development you run the daemon and the UI directly. The packaged app is built only for releases.

## Toolchain

The repo ships a **Nix flake devshell** that pins bun, Rust, `cargo-tauri`, and `pkg-config`. With [direnv](https://direnv.net):

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `direnv allow` | Loads the devshell on entry; or run `nix develop` |

The Python harness runs from a local virtualenv managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `uv sync` | Create .venv and install the project + dependencies |

## Running it

The CLI starts the daemon on its first command, so usually there is nothing to launch:

```shell
uv run langmesh create --agent general-assistant --directory ~/code/project
uv run langmesh send "$id" "What does this project do?" --wait
```

The [`langmesh` command](cli.md) is the full surface. To run the daemon in the foreground instead — the fastest way to watch a traceback — start it by name:

```shell
uv run python -m langmesh langmeshd
```

One image, two entry points, chosen by the first argument: `langmesh` (the CLI) and `langmeshd` (the daemon, which hosts the sessions). A bare launch lands in the CLI, which is why the daemon has to be asked for. `langmesh daemon stop` takes down a foreground daemon and its sessions with it.

A session is an object the daemon builds and holds, not a process. Creating one costs about as much as constructing the object, which is why there is no pool of anything waiting.

It listens on a unix socket in your runtime directory. For GUI clients it also listens on an ephemeral loopback port. `langmesh daemon endpoint` reports the port and the capability token.

State follows the XDG convention, and all of it is created on first run:

- Configuration in `~/.config/langmesh/`
- Durable state in `~/.local/share/langmesh/`
- Logs in `~/.local/state/langmesh/`

Add provider keys with `langmesh configure`, in the configuration file, or through environment variables. See the [Configuration guide](configuration.md).

## Running the web UI

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `cd web && bun install` | Once |
| `./scripts/web-development.sh` | Http://localhost:3000, wired to the daemon already running |

Start the daemon first; the script starts a local bridge on port 8824 when one is not already answering, and the development page reads that stable address from its runtime descriptor. The bridge owns the ephemeral daemon port and capability token, re-reading both after a restart, so no credential or short-lived endpoint is embedded in the Next.js bundle.

Run the script from an **ordinary shell, not from inside `nix develop`**. The devshell rewrites `TMPDIR`, the runtime directory hangs off it, and a daemon started outside the devshell is therefore invisible to anything started inside it. The script enters the devshell itself only for the Bun process.

Useful scripts (in `web/`):

- `bun run lint` — lint the UI.
- `bun run tauri:dev` / `bun run tauri:build` — the desktop shell (see below).
- `bun run build` — production static export (to `web/out`).
- `bun run build:events` — regenerate the TypeScript event schema from the Python models (`scripts/generate_event_schema.py`). Run this whenever the event contract changes.

Outside `web/` the package layering runs `base`, then `protocol`, then `computer`/`locations`, then `runtime`, then `worker`. The daemon sits on top and hosts the sessions, so it imports the runtime at boot. Two invariants ride on the layering, and neither is visible in a diff. Check each by hand when you touch its area:

- **`computer/` is never imported at module level.** It pulls in PyObjC, which is heavy, and most sessions never drive the screen.
- **Nothing reaches the network at import.** A catalogue fetch at module scope blocks the daemon's boot behind a stranger's endpoint, and every session waits on that boot.
- **The runtime keeps no process-wide state.** Nothing under `runtime/` parks a caller's argument in a module global. Nothing installs a signal handler or registers an exit hook. The runtime is a library now, and one process may host more than one session.

A new setting is a field on the configuration model, and then three things that are not in the code with it. The schema walk finds the field on its own, so `langmesh configure` and the settings panel both have it from the moment it exists — but the panel draws it with **a label and a sentence from `shared/messages/*.json`**, in every locale, and the [configuration reference](configuration-reference.md) needs **a row**. What a setting is called and what it is for are words to translate, so they live where the rest of the interface's words live; the schema carries only what a setting *is*.

## Running the desktop app in dev

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `langmesh serve` | Starts the checkout daemon the development app should use |
| `cd web` |  |
| `bun run tauri:dev` | Launches the Tauri window against the dev UI |

Start the checkout daemon before the development window so testing never silently switches to the installed production build. Automatic local startup belongs only to a release app.

## Logs and copy

Two vocabularies, and they are not the same thing.

**A log message is an event name.** Lowercase, no terminal punctuation, and the facts go in fields rather than into the sentence — `logger.info("session %s sleeping after %.0fs idle", …)`. This is what makes a line groupable: the message is a label you filter on, not prose you read. Acronyms and proper nouns keep their capitals wherever they fall, including first (`MCP server %r failed to start`), because those are spellings rather than casing.

**Human copy is prose.** The interface catalog, an `HTTPException` `detail`, an `RpcError`, CLI output: sentence case with terminal punctuation, because a person reads it as a sentence. A fragment used as a label or a chip — `high risk`, `waiting`, `write` — stays lowercase; it is not a sentence.

**Never interpolate an exception into a log message.** An exception's message is human copy, so `logger.error("could not start session %s: %s", identifier, error)` staples a sentence — often one wrapping a JSON document — onto the end of an event. Pass the traceback with `exc_info=True`, or the fields with `langmesh.base.errors.describe`, and leave the message an event.

The interface follows the same split: `swallowed({ component, operation }, error)` carries the place and the attempt as fields, and `serialize-error` parses whatever was thrown — JavaScript lets you throw a string, so a caught value may have no `message` at all.

## Building and signing

There are **two artifacts**, built independently, because the app is a client of the daemon rather than its container. Building one never rebuilds the other.

Build the daemon first. It is one image with two entry points: the daemon and the CLI. Set `FORCE=1` to rebuild when the freshness guard says the build is current.

```shell
packaging/build-daemon.sh
```

Then the desktop app, which is a Tauri shell with no Python in it at all:

```shell
cd web && bun run tauri:build
```

The first freezes the harness with PyInstaller into `packaging/dist/LangMesh Computer Use.app`, smoke-tests it, and is a no-op when nothing that goes into it has changed. The second produces `web/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/LangMesh.app`.

It does **not** build a disk image. Installing locally is a `ditto` of the `.app`, and creating, mounting and converting a `.dmg` took about a quarter of every build to produce a file nothing here reads. Use `bun run tauri:dmg` when you actually want one to hand out.

The rest of the time is Rust, and it is not incremental: cargo disables incremental compilation for the `release` profile, and the shell is invalidated on every run anyway because `next build` rewrites `web/out`, which Tauri's build script watches. So a rebuild costs roughly a minute whether or not the frontend changed — which is the reason to rebuild only when it did. A Python-only change needs `packaging/build-daemon.sh` and a daemon restart, nothing more.

The smoke test runs the frozen daemon under a **throwaway set of XDG directories**, which is load-bearing rather than tidy. With your own directories it would find the lock held by the daemon you already run. It would stand down and exit `0`. The probe would then find *that* daemon's socket answering. That is a green result for a binary the probe never exercised, in the most common case of all.

Isolation means the binary under test is the only thing that can answer. It also keeps a build from seeding your configuration or writing to your transcript store.

For the full step-by-step with expected output, see [Installation](installation.md#every-step-and-what-you-should-see).

### Stable code-signing (recommended)

The screen-control tools (`control_screen`) need the macOS **Accessibility** grant, which is tied to code identity. Every session runs inside the daemon for exactly this reason — one grant covers the fleet. Both artifacts carry the same `CFBundleName` and identifier, so signing both with one persistent identity keeps them a single **LangMesh** row that survives rebuilds:

Create the self-signed identity in your login keychain once:

```shell
packaging/create-signing-certificate.sh
```

Then sign after each build, either artifact or both:

```shell
packaging/sign-app.sh "packaging/dist/LangMesh Computer Use.app"
packaging/sign-app.sh web/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/LangMesh.app
```

The daemon is signed `--deep` with `packaging/Entitlements.plist`. It sends Apple Events for its login-items and running-apps probes. It also loads PyInstaller's dylibs without library validation. The app needs neither entitlement, so it signs plain. The identity is self-signed, so Gatekeeper still warns on other machines until a build is Apple-notarized.

### Installing the daemon

```shell
ditto "packaging/dist/LangMesh Computer Use.app" "/Applications/LangMesh Computer Use.app"
ln -sf "/Applications/LangMesh Computer Use.app/Contents/MacOS/langmesh" /usr/local/bin/langmesh
```

The symlink is what puts `langmesh` and `langmeshd` on your `PATH`, both entering the same signed image. Running from a checkout (`uv run langmesh …`) works for everything except a stable Accessibility grant, since the interpreter is then the code identity.

## Tests

The repository ships **no unit-test suite**. It ships a **verification battery** instead. The battery holds the specific, falsifiable claims that the architecture rests on, and it checks each one by doing it:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `uv run ruff check src/ scripts/` |  |
| `cd web && bun run build` | Regenerates and diffs the event schema, then type-checks |

Each stage gets its own temporary XDG roots and its own daemon and cleans up after itself, so a run touches nothing of yours. Exit status is the number of failures.

Two stages need a real machine and are skipped elsewhere, which is the reason to run this locally at least once. `macos-confinement` answers the questions that only macOS can answer:

- Does the Accessibility grant cover the daemon that asks for it?
- Does `sandbox-exec` still confine a tool child?

It also counts threads with mach, which is how a thread leak in the daemon shows itself.

Confinement is only genuinely exercised where the kernel can enforce it. Without Landlock, or a working `sandbox-exec`, the battery runs with `sandbox.enforce: preferred`. The sandbox is then never applied.

Beyond the battery: lint with `uv run ruff check`, and drive the affected path through the CLI directly. `pyproject.toml` is already set up for `pytest` (`testpaths = ["tests"]`, `asyncio_mode = "auto"`), so if you add a `tests/` directory `uv run pytest` will pick it up.

## Project layout

**`src/langmesh/`** — the Python image, in the import order stated below:

| Module | What lives there |
|---|---|
| `base/` | Configuration, XDG paths, skills, ports, the catalogue |
| `protocol/` | A2A cards, DTOs, the wire contract |
| `computer/` | macOS screen-control bridges: native apps and Chrome |
| `locations/` | Where files live: local, SSH, containers |
| `runtime/` | The agent loop, prompts, tools, models |
| `worker/` | What a session is made of: its executor, its verbs, its turn loop |
| `__init__.py` | The library surface: `langmesh.Session` and its seams |
| `workspace/` | Projects, locations, settings, terminals — beside the rest, not above |
| `daemon/` | `langmeshd`: registry, lifecycle, the session host, machine loaders |
| `rest/` | The REST surface the browser uses; never imports `daemon` |
